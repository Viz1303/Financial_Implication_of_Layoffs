# Financial Implications of Layoffs (2022–23)

## Problem Statement
Layoffs are a recurring feature of modern economies, with ripple effects that extend beyond cost-cutting measures. They impact:
- **Individuals**: job loss, reduced income, uncertainty.
- **Companies**: short-term financial relief but long-term innovation loss.
- **Economies**: decreased consumer spending, higher unemployment, reduced tax revenues.

The 2022–23 wave of layoffs, especially in the **tech sector**, raised urgent questions:
- How do layoffs affect employees, companies, and the broader economy?
- What global and industry patterns can we observe?
- Do layoffs improve corporate financial performance or create hidden costs?
- How quickly do workers recover after being laid off?

This project explores these questions through **historical, global, industry, and company-level analysis**.

## Methodology & Rationale
1. **Historical Context**  
   - Benchmarked against some of the largest layoffs in history (IBM, Citigroup, GM, Sears, Lehman Brothers, etc.).

2. **Global & Industry-Level Analysis**  
   - Mapped layoffs across **countries (2020–2023)**.  
   - Compared industries (tech, retail, healthcare, transportation, finance).  

3. **Company-Level Insights**  
   - Analyzed top firms (Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Uber, Booking.com).  
   - Compared **absolute layoff counts vs % of workforce impacted**.  
   - Looked at **funds raised vs layoffs** to reveal contradictions.

4. **Financial Impact**  
   - Studied **stock price reactions** and **earnings per share** across industries post-layoff.  

5. **Recovery & Human Impact**  
   - Tracked **job search durations post-layoffs**.  
   - Compared tech vs overall workforce reabsorption into new jobs.

**Rationale**: Combining financial, organizational, and human data offers a **360° perspective** on the true cost of layoffs.

## Key Insights & Narrative
- **Layoffs Are Cyclical**: Economic downturns, restructuring, and investor pressure drive recurring waves of layoffs.  
- **US Dominates Global Layoffs**: The US consistently leads, with India and Brazil also showing sharp increases.  
- **Tech & Retail Hit Hardest**: Tech layoffs surged **352% in 2023 vs 2022**, while retail layoffs reflected consumer demand shifts.  
- **Contradictory Corporate Behavior**: Companies like Meta raised **$26B** while cutting 11,000 jobs; Booking.com cut **25% of staff**, the highest ratio.  
- **Stock Market Reaction**: Short-term stock boosts often occurred, but long-term recovery was inconsistent and industry-dependent.  
- **Human Resilience**: Most workers found jobs within **1–3 months**, especially in tech, showing strong labor market absorption.

## Lessons Learned
1. **Layoffs ≠ Long-Term Solution**: Short-term financial relief often creates hidden costs (innovation loss, lower morale).  
2. **Industry Context Matters**: Recovery differs by sector — tech rebounds faster than retail or transportation.  
3. **Data Storytelling is Powerful**: Visualizations helped uncover patterns not visible in raw numbers.  
4. **Resilience of Talent**: Many workers re-entered the job market quickly, keeping unemployment rates stable despite layoffs.  
5. **Future Outlook**: Layoffs will remain cyclical — balancing **financial efficiency with human sustainability** is crucial.
